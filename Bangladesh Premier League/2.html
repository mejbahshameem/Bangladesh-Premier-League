<p style="color:white;">Chittagong Vikings captain Tamim Iqbal said that a missed run-out chance and a dropped catch cost the side dearly in their 33-run loss to Barisal Bulls on Monday.

Ziaur Rahman was involved in both incidents, in the 14th and 16th overs of Barisal's innings. He first bungled a run-out chance against Mahmudullah, who was on 27 at the time; Mahmudullah went on to score 51. Ziaur appeared to have disturbed the stumps just before the throw hit the stumps, but the TV replays were inconclusive in determining if the bowler had broken the bails.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Two overs later, he dropped Seekkuge Prasanna on 22, and parried the ball for six at long-off. Naeem Islam, did a similar thing a few deliveries later, conceding a six over long-on. Chittagong's overall cricket was also sloppy - Elton Chigumbura bowled a nine-ball over and Kamran Akmal was run-out for a duck after he failed to slide his bat in while attempting a single.</p>
<p style="color:white;">"We made a beautiful start, especially in the first six overs but then it was the same old story. We missed a simple run-out of Mahmudullah and Prasanna survived an easy catch. And they took the game away from us in that Elton [Chigumbura] over. But I don't want to take the credit away from Mahmudullah and Barisal," Tamim said.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Chigumbura had already given away 16 runs in his first over when Tamim recalled him in the 19th over. He gave away 22 runs, which included a four that was hit off a no-ball and was followed by two wides.

"We have some plans in the team meeting," Tamim said. "We knew that [Kevon] Cooper loves to hit over cover and straight. When Elton was bowling, I was trying to tell him to bowl in such a way that he hits towards square-leg or the midwicket area, where he had a better chance to get a wicket or give away singles as it was the larger side of the ground. But, unfortunately, he bowled the wrong line."</p>
<p style="color:white;">Tamim said that Akmal's dismissal was a "schoolboy error": "All I can say is that Kamran's run-out was a schoolboy error. All of our foreign players know what to do. They can improve. I really don't have an answer for Kamran's run-out. If someone like Dilshan, a batsman rated as high as Chris Gayle in T20s, did the job with bat and ball, we would have been in a good position. We depend a lot on them, which they have to understand."
