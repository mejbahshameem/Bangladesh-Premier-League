		a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Championship game, played between the two winners of the semi-finals.<br>

		   The BPL was formed in 2012 by the BCB, with six original founding club franchises. After the first two seasons, all six franchises were suspended by the governing committee for violating 
		   the tournament regulations. Due to that, the third edition was indefinitely postponed, and was later held in 2015 with six new franchises. The number of teams will be increased to eight 
		   from the fourth edition of the tournament.[3] The BPL had the third highest average attendance among all cricket leagues with respect to the average crowd per match during the 2015 season.
		   In 2016, the BPL was revealed as the second most followed cricket league in the world, second to the Indian Premier League (IPL).[4] The brand valuation of BPL is estimated at around
		   $500 million.<br>

			tournament. The current champions are the Comilla Victorians, who defeated the Barisal Bulls by three wickets in BPL III.</p>
