<p style="color:white;">Rangpur Riders captain Shakib Al Hasan has been suspended for one BPL match and fined Tk 20000 for two counts of breaching the BCB's code of conduct during the match against Sylhet Super Stars on Thursday. He will miss his side's clash against Comilla Victorians, on Friday.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Shakib was reported by the on-field umpires Ranmore Martinesz and Tanvir Ahmed for using abusive language after dismissing Sylhet batsman Dilshan Munaweera in the fourth over. His suspension was for directing offensive and abusive language towards the umpire Tanvir in the 13th over of the Sylhet innings, when an appeal for a wicket was turned down. On that instance, Thisara Perera got one to rise sharply at Mushfiqur Rahim but there was no clear evidence of an edge from multiple angles. The umpire was seen visibly shocked by Shakib's words at the end of the over.</p>
<p style="color:white;">The BCB press release said that as Shakib admitted the offences and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Salim Shahed, a formal hearing was not required.</p>
